# Our view of moderation

## Freedom of speech, not permissiveness
We believe that freedom of speech is a basic human right, but we consider freedom of speech in traditional way. As ability to say anything that is legal.<br>
Because of this, we need moderation.<br><br>
But moderation in old social media like Twitter ban your account everywhere, cause its centralized.<br>
We believe in decentalized moderation by every instance. Like in Mastodon.<br><br>
But in Mastodon and in all federated social networks your posts are on some server.<br>
And if the owner of instance wants to block you, others will not be able to view your posts on other instances.<br><br>
**We do moderation right.**<br>
If you are the owner of Netance instance, you can block TON addresses locally on your instance, that violates your instance's rules.<br>
But you cant block user that uses your instance everywhere. And this user is not linked to your instance, since all the posts are in blockchain.<br>
And also! All the banned users on every server are public for everyone. They are always available on ```/banned_users_list```, for example:<br>
