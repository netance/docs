# Choose an instance

You can write posts on any instance, since they are stored in blockchain.<br>
Your account is your TON wallet address, not some kind of username.<br>
<br>
We have [our own instance](https://app.netance.ru/create) with pretty simple [rules](https://netance.github.io/docs/rules) and [privacy policy](https://netance.github.io/docs/privacy).<br>
We will ban your account only on our instance if it violates our rules.<br>
Because Netance is decentralized, your messages will be available on other instances.<br>
Learn more about our view on moderation [here.](https://netance.github.io/docs/aboutmoderation)<br><br>
You must not choose our instance. You can choose other one or run your own.<br><br>
Your profile will be located at ```/b?address=[YOUR_ADDRESS]```, for example:<br>

Netance was made by ftc - a group of developers behind TON Sign.
